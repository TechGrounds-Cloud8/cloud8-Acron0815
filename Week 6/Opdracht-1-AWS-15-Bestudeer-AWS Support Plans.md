# AWS Support Plans


AWS Support offers a range of plans that provide access to tools and expertise that support the success and operational health of your AWS solutions. All support plans provide 24/7 access to customer service, AWS documentation, technical papers, and support forums. For technical support and more resources to plan, deploy, and improve your AWS environment, you can choose a support plan that best aligns with your AWS use case.

## AWS Support offers five support plans:

- Basic

Each customer automatically gains AWS Basic Support that is free. This tier includes:

-Customer service & communities - around-the-clock access to customer service, relevant documentation and whitepapers, support forums, and communities like AWS re:Post. Thanks to Basic Support, your organization may also contact AWS to ask billing questions or increase service limits.

-AWS Trusted Advisor - access to a limited number of AWS Trusted Advisor checks, along with guidance for provisioning your AWS resources depending on best practices. That allows increasing performance and improving security. 

-AWS Personal Health Dashboard - this tool offers a personalized view of your AWS services’ health. Also, it provides alerts and remediation guidance if your AWS resources are affected. 

- Developer

With the Developer Support plan, your organization can email client support directly and get a response to critical questions within 24 hours. Also, you may even receive a response within less than 12 hours when your system is impaired. The Developer tier is perfect for companies that experiment with Amazon Web Services or set up testing or proofs of concept. 

Clients using the particular Support plan obtain the following features: 

-Best practice guides.

-Customer-side diagnostic tools.

-Building-block architecture support that involves guidance on using AWS offerings, features, and numerous services together.

- Business

When customers start running production workloads on Amazon Web Services, they should advance to the Business Support plan. This tier includes everything offered by the previous ones. But here, Trusted Advisor will open up the whole set of checks for your AWS account. Thus, you obtain direct phone access to the AWS support team that provides a four-hour response time depending on SLA (service-level agreement). However, when your system is impaired, you will get a response within only one hour. 

In addition, as an important component of the Business Support plan, AWS allows accessing infrastructure event management. For the additional fee, Amazon Web Services can help your company plan for different massive events such as brand new launches and advertising blitzes. 

Clients using this tier gain access to extra features, including: 

-Use-case guidance for identifying AWS offerings, features, and services which can satisfy your organization’s specific requirements.

-All checks offered by AWS Trusted Advisor.

-Limited support regarding third-party software (like common operating systems or application stack components).

- Enterprise On-Ramp

- Enterprise

For organizations that run mission-critical workloads, it is critical to use the Enterprise Support plan. The Enterprise tier involves everything from the previous plans. Also, it provides a 15-minute response time for critical workloads. 

Customers using this plan will obtain features like: 

-Application architecture guidance that serves as a consultative relationship for supporting your organization’s specific use cases or apps.

-Infrastructure event management that is considered a short-term engagement with AWS Support. It allows gaining a better understanding of the company’s use cases and offers appropriate architectural and scaling guidance.

-TAM (Technical Account Manager).
