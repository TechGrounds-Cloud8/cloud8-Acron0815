# Firewalls
The quick-and-dirty definition is that a
firewall is a boundary network device that resides between a private network
and the Internet. The firewall is configured to inspect the network traffic that
passes between the Internet and your network and only allows the network
protocols that you desire to pass through the firewall. If a protocol isnâ€™t
included in the approved list, the firewall discards the packets of data and
prevents them from entering the network.

When I hear "Firewalls" I think of a computer geek sitting in the office (in
a darkened closet), with his router and a handy toolkit, tries to keep hackers out.

## Key terminology
- Access control list (ACL)

A list of individual users and groups of users associated with an object, and the rights that the user or group has when accessing that object.

- Back door

An intentional hole in a firewall or security apparatus that allows access around security measures.

- Daemon

A process that performs a specified operation at a predefined time or in response to certain events. Daemon is a UNIX term. In other operating systems such as Windows, daemons are referred to as services.

- Firewall

A security system designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network. Firewalls can be implemented in both hardware and software, or a combination of both.
