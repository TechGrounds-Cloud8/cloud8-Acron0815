# IP IP Addresses
IP stands for Internet Protocol, which is a set of standard predefined rules used to govern the way data packets are sent over the internet. For two devices to communicate, they must be able to find each other. For two devices to find each other, their locations must be known to each other. These locations are identified in the computer world as IP addresses. An IP address, which is usually just called an IP, is a series of numbers used to uniquely identify a computer/device on a network or on the internet. The IP address basically indicates the location of a device on a network: it is a unique identifier for devices. This is similar to an address uniquely identifying a house. Every house is identified by a street number (IP address) that can be located on a certain street (network address). As such, two computers cannot have the same IP address on a network.

The addresses facilitate the devices' transmission of messages back and forth to each other. If you want to send an email, stream a video online, or receive a document, your device must have an IP address. Without this, the device cannot effectively communicate with or be located by other devices on the internet.

## Key terminology
An Internet Protocol Address (IP address) refers to a unique address or numerical label designated for each device connected in a computer network using the Internet Protocol (IP) for communication.

Example of an IP address: 192.16.2.1

Simply put, IP addresses identify a device on a local network or the internet and allow data to be transmitted between the devices, containing location information while making devices accessible for easy communication. IP addresses offer a great way of differentiating between different devices like computers, printers, websites, routers, etc.

An IP address is used for two purposes:

- Location finding
- Identifying host/network interface


### What does IP mean?  
It is nothing more than 'Internet Protocol', and the IP address as such is nothing more than an identifier. We are talking about a number assigned in the network, which basically serves to identify connected devices. Still, you should know that there are two different types of IP addresses: the public ip address and private ip address. And no, although it may seem that they are, they are not the same, but also that both addresses perform a completely different function than any other IP address.

### Private IP address
We will now go for the private IP address which is basically the one assigned to a device, as the name suggests, private. What does this mean? What It is in fact the one assigned within a private network on the side of the entrance door that, as a general rule, will be a device that can sound a little more to you, the router, where you will be fine. If we don't want a conflict to arise in the internal relationships that exist between every smart mobile phone or smartphone, the game consoles in your home, or the same TV and other devices you have connected, you must have a different and corresponding private IP -address ranked by class.
There are three types of classes:

- Class a: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255.
- Class B: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255.
- Class c: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255.

Basically, what the different classes of private IP addresses do is determine the possible ranges you can assign to the devices connected to your network. More specifically, class A is used for large international companies, while private IP addresses that fall within class B are used for medium-sized companies and the ones that stay in class C are the ones we will find more often for home networks (like your home) and especially in small networks due to the number of devices connected to them.

With this we know that it is common that in every home of a regular user the IP address 192.168.1.1 is configured by default for your router, and the private IP addresses such as 192.168.1.x It is used for the rest of the devices connected to the local network.


### Public IP address

The one we know from the public IP address is, in fact, the one that the internet service provider (what we know as operator, any brand works for us here) assign a customer (You can be the customer). All this helps us to identify devices or entire networks in the network and which are generally named dynamic ip.

The devices called clients, both computers and mobile phones or smartphones and many others that are used to surf the Internet, are constantly identified on the network with a public IP address that is visible to all. In addition to the latter, the static public IP address, the servers on which the pages are hosted and various web services that we are used to rent are also identified in this way.

In the latter case, of web servers, we have to say that there is a dependency on the DNS servers. Since the user basically writes a URL address in the web browser to get the load of a web page (which we all know how to do), the web server then starts a query to the DNS servers that receive it to process it and finally They solve the name of what we know by domain (address you type) by finding its IP address and then the web page you wanted to enter will be loaded on your screen to see all web content.

You usually don't know this public IP address, but it is registered behind by the DNS servers that are the ones that activate the whole process and make sure that one point converges with the other so that you can receive the web content.



### Exercise

Find out what your public IP address is of your laptop and mobile

### Are the IP addresses the same or not? Explain why.


If you are on the internet at home via wifi, your phone has a different ip address than when you connect via the mobile network.

The IP address you have at home is the address assigned to the modem by your internet provider. As a result, all devices that access the internet via that connection have the same IP address for the outside world.

When you connect via your mobile network, you have a different connection, which also includes a different IP address.

You can connect multiple devices to the internet at home via your (Wi-Fi) router at the same time. To the outside world they all have the same (external) IP address. So whether you access the internet via a laptop, game console or smartphone, the IP address remains the same. Your router makes sure that everything goes well.

The IP address that your phone actually has is an internal IP address. This means that the IP address is only visible within your own network. These internal IP addresses are assigned by your (Wi-Fi) router. But from the outside (i.e. from the internet) that internal IP address cannot be seen, but only the external IP address.

### Change the private IP address of your mobile to that of your laptop. What happens then?

Keep in mind, changing your IP address will temporarily disrupt whatever internet-connected services or programs you're using on your device. There's no harm done, but it's going to have the same effect as if you'd momentarily lost your Wi-Fi.

### The difference between Public and Private IP addresses.

Private IP address of a system is the IP address which is used to communicate within the same network. Using private IP data or information can be sent or received within the same network.

Public IP address of a system is the IP address which is used to communicate outside the network. Public IP address is basically assigned by the ISP (Internet Service Provider).
