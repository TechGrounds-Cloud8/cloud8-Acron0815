# VPC

The best of both worlds: 

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) offers me the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of the public cloud together with the security of a private cloud. With the Amazon Cloud, setting it up is a basic requirement as a basic security measure for the use of almost all cloud resources. Each user receives at least one VPC.

A VPC lets me build my own private environment on top of a shared, public cloud infrastructure. This gives me an area isolated from everyone else using the public cloudâ€”a private, secure space for data.

## Key terminology

- Virtual Private Cloud compared to a Private Cloud

A virtual private cloud is an alternative to the private cloud. It offers an environment within a public cloud that is strictly separated from other users' areas. For example, imagine the infrastructure of a cloud provider as a restaurant with tables. In a public cloud, users share resources - that is, they take a seat at the free tables. A virtual private cloud is like a reserved table where only certain guests are allowed to sit.

A virtual private cloud from Amazon AWS offers a number of advantages over a self-operated and managed private cloud.

Agility: 

I can adjust the size of my virtual network to my needs at any time and dynamically scale the resources used.

Availability: 

With redundant resources and highly fault-tolerant architectures, Amazon AWS can ensure availability for applications and workloads that most individuals or organizations cannot match.

Affordability: 

VPC customers can take advantage of the cost efficiencies of a public cloud, such as savings in hardware costs.

 - ### VPC management is typically done through my provider's (e.g. Amazon AWS) control panel . This access to my VPC allows me to easily make and track changes as needed.
