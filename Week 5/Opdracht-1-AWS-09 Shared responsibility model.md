# Shared Responsibility Model

### Most cloud security incidents are more often due to customer error than vendor error. The shared responsibility model indicates where the cloud provider's responsibility ends and mine (as the user) begins.

- ### What does shared responsibility mean?

I have found that the shared responsibility model describes what I am responsible for as a cloud customer and what my cloud service provider is responsible for. 

My cloud service provider is responsible for security "of" the cloud - e.g. physical facilities, utilities, cables, hardware, etc. 

As a customer, I am responsible for security "in" the cloud - e.g. for network controls, identity and access management, application configurations and data.

- ### Who is responsible for the security of data in the shared responsibility model?

According to the Shared Responsibility Model, customers are responsible for securing their own data, access and authorizations.

## Key terminology

However, this distribution of tasks may change depending on the service model I used. There are mainly three cloud service models:

- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

A form of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources. I essentially use IaaS to replace physical resources, such as servers, with virtual resources hosted and managed by Amazon.

- PaaS (Platform as a Service)

A platform provides a complete solution for running software in an integrated manner on a particular piece of hardware. For example, Windows is a particular kind of platform. The virtual platform provided by PaaS allows me (as a customer) to develop, run, and manage applications of all sorts.

- SaaS (Software as a Service)

A software distribution service that lets me use applications without actually having the applications installed locally. Another term used to describe this service is software on demand. The host, Amazon, maintains the software, provides the required licenses, and does all the other work needed to make the software available.

## Overcome challanges

When searching quickly and in too many sources, it is difficult to discern what is helpful information and what is not.

## Results

I personally think that " The Cloud" probably the future of the digital market is, but it is very important to protect the data and applications parked there well.
