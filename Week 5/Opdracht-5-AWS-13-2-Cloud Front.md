 CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) service that makes it possible to deliver applications, data, videos and APIs in a developer-friendly environment.

 - Here are a few advantages of CloudFront

 -It uses HTTP or HTTPS protocols for quick delivery of content.

-It's easy to start to use the CDN service once you host your website on Amazon

-Users get lower latency (the time it takes to load the first byte of the file) and higher data transfer rates.


- Here are a few downsides of CloudFront

-Be ready for a ton of tech jargon that you are definitely not going to understand if you are new to this.

-The pricing is not so transparent.

-I (you) will need a specialist to manage it.

## Results

Setting up a CDN (Content Delivery Network) is quick and easy with the help of CloudFront. Thanks to a CDN, a website can deliver static data to an incalculable number of users, regardless of the server. The website is therefore always available and will in all probability not suffer any failure, the server cannot overload!

## Summary

I find that CloudFront is very flexible and works well with other Amazon services, as is the case with most things on AWS.

Amazon CloudFront claims to be a fast content delivery service that securely delivers data, video, applications, and APIs to customers around the world with low latency and high transfer speeds - all within a developer-friendly environment. Benefits of using it include the provision of the highly resilient Amazon backbone network, network and application layer protection, custom programmability, and tight integration with AWS. The pricing model is usage-based; the free version includes 50 GB data transfer out and 2 million HTTP and HTTPS requests per month for one year.

## Overcome challanges

AWS interface is a bit overwhelming and daunting at first.

Be ready for a ton of tech jargon that you are definitely not going to understand if you are new to this.

I tried to use what I had learned so far as much as possible in order to achieve a satisfactory result.
