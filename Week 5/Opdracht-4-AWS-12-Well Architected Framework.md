# Well Architected Framework

## The AWS Well Architected Framework checks, improves and optimizes processes and structures within my environment.
---

The AWS Well Architected Framework helps cloud architects build the most secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure possible for their applications. The framework provides a consistent approach for customers and AWS Partners to evaluate architectures, and provides guidance to implement designs that scale with your application needs over time.

### Key terminology

Well Architected Framework is based on six pillars:

![Framework](../00_includes/AWS-12%20Well%20Architected%20Framework/Framework.PNG)

1. Operational Excellence

2. Security

3. Reliability

4. Performance Efficiency

5. Cost Optimization

6. Sustainability

- 1 -
Operational excellence focuses on the continuous optimization of the cloud environment and the monitoring of the running systems. The aim of the AWS Well Architected Framework is to offer improved value creation through optimized structures and processes.

- To implement Operational Excellence please use services like CloudWatch, CloudTrail, X-Ray and VPC Flow Logs. Familiarize yourself with the health of your workload.

- 2 - Security: Within IT, the protection of data and systems has the highest priority. During the AWS Well Architected Framework, particularly security-critical points such as rights management in my AWS environment and, for example, the control for early detection of security risks and incidents are considered. If security gaps are revealed, appropriate optimization processes are suggested.

- 3 - Reliability of cloud environments is defined with a high level of error prevention and rapid and automated recovery of the systems in the event of a failure. The AWS Well Architected Framework is designed to identify resource bottlenecks and request capacity extension.

- 4 - The Performance Efficiency pillar includes the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.

- 5 - Cost Optimization: The number one issue in any IT or cloud environment is cost. How much does the area cost? How can costs be saved? The AWS Well Architected Framework carries out an extensive cost analysis. The results are concrete measures that contribute to cost savings within the cloud infrastructure. Capacity reservations such as Reserved Instances or Saving Plans, or resource optimization are possible measures.

- 6 - Sustainability: The sustainability pillar minimizes the environmental impact of using cloud workloads. Cloud workloads are proven to be the greenest way to run IT in terms of saving water and energy resources.

### Exercise

Study long and hard and hopefully enough information will stick.

### Sources

The usual ones like the internet, YouTube, Lynda tutorials, e-books, usenet and especially this one:

### Overcome challanges

Searching for current and relevant information.

AWS interface is a bit overwhelming and daunting at first.

Be ready for a ton of tech jargon that you are definitely not going to understand if you are new to this.

I tried to use what I had learned so far as much as possible in order to achieve a satisfactory result.

### Results

Are interesting and give an insight into the complexity and the importance of the matter.

The AWS Well-Architected Framework is a combination of a few areas that allows me, as an AWS customer and user, to build robust, scalable architectures and solutions and evaluate them appropriately. Although this article focuses on design principles in AWS, the concepts can be the same for any other cloud application architecture.
