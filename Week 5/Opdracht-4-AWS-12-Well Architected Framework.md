# Well Architected Framework


The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps cloud architects build the most secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure possible for their applications. The framework provides a consistent approach for customers and AWS Partners to evaluate architectures, and provides guidance to implement designs that scale with your application needs over time.

The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the pros and cons of the decisions you make when building systems on AWS
meeting. The framework helps you identify architectural best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the cloud. It gives you the ability to consistently audit your architectures for compliance with best practices and identify areas for improvement. An architecture review is not an audit. Rather it is
a constructive conversation about architectural choices.
We are convinced that architecturally good systems increase the likelihood
of business success.
AWS Solutions Architects have been designing architectures for a wide variety of industries and use cases for many years. We were designing and reviewing
Thousands of customer architectures involved on AWS. So we know the proven ones
Methods and core strategies for successful system architectures in the cloud.
The AWS Well-Architected Framework documents fundamental questions that
They clarify whether an architecture is flawless using best practices for the cloud
is compatible. The framework gives you a unified approach
to evaluate the properties you have of modern cloud-based systems
expect, as well as suggestions for realizing these properties. AWS developed
is constantly evolving, and we, too, are constantly learning new things through working with our customers. And as our knowledge grows, we can always be more precise
define what characterizes a good architectural structure.
This framework is intended for technology professionals, e.g. B. Chief Technology Officers (CTO), architects, developers and operations staff. It includes AWS best practices and strategies for designing and deploying cloud workloads. The links point to more implementation details and architecture models. Visit AWS for more information

AWS also offers to review your workloads for free. The AWS Well-Architected Tool (AWS WA Tool) is a service in the cloud that provides a unified process
to validate and measure your architecture with AWS Well-Architected Framework
offers. The AWS WA Tool gives you recommendations on how to make your workloads more reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective.
