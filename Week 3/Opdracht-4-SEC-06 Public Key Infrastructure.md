# Public Key Infrastructure


The Public Key Infrastructure concept is based on a public key and a private key.
The PKI verifies the identity of the key pair owner and then issues a certificate to the public key, attesting to the authenticity of the key pair.
If the communication participants want to check the identities, they can query the authenticity of the certificates via the PKI.
