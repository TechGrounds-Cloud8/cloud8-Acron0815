# Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric encryption is a type of encryption that uses two separates yet mathematically related keys to encrypt and decrypt data. The public key encrypts data while its corresponding private key decrypts it. This is why it's also known as public key encryption, public key cryptography, and asymmetric key encryption.

## Key terminology

### - Private key 

A private key, is a variable in cryptography that is used with an algorithm to encrypt and decrypt data. Private keys should only be shared with the key's generator or parties authorized to decrypt the data. Private keys play an important role in symmetric cryptography, asymmetric cryptography and cryptocurrencies.


### - Public key 
A public key is a large numerical value that is used to encrypt data. The key can be generated by a software program, but more often, it is provided by a trusted, designated authority and made available to everyone through a publicly accessible repository or directory.

### - Asymmetric Key Encryption

Examples: Diffie-Hellman, ECC, El Gamal, DSA and RSA



## Exercise

Generate a key pair.

Send an asymmetrically encrypted message to one of your peers via the public Slack channel. They should be able to decrypt the message using a key you share with them. The recipient should be able to read the message, but it should remain a secret to everyone else.
You are not allowed to use any private messages or other communication channels besides Slack. Analyse the difference between this method and symmetric encryption.

## What is difference between asymmetric and symmetric encryption and which is better?

Asymmetric encryption is the more secure one, while symmetric encryption is faster. 
They're both very effective in different ways and, depending on the task at hand, either or both may be deployed alone or together. 
Only one key (symmetric key) is used, and the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the message.


## Overcome challanges

I was trying to learn how asymmetric encryption works and trying to understand how to generate keys using a key pair generator.
