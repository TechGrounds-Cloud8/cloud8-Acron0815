# Symmetric encryption


## Caesar cipher. 

This cipher is attributed to Julius Caesar, who is said to have used it to communicate securely with his generals. 
It is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a specific number of places down the alphabet. 
The shift number said to be used by Caesar was three. 
Substitution ciphers are often implemented by writing down the plaintext alphabet, with the ciphertext alphabet written above 
the plaintext letters, shifted by the number those communicating agree to. 
A shift of three puts the letter D above the plaintext A, E above B and so on. 
The number of characters shifted is considered a simple form of a key.


### 1. Find two more historic ciphers besides the Caesar cipher. 

- Simple substitution

This one has also been used for hundreds of years. It substitutes every plaintext character for a different ciphertext character, 
resulting in what is effectively a 26-character key. 
It differs from the Caesar cipher because the enciphering alphabet is completely jumbled, rather than simply shifted a 
uniform number of places.

-  The Scytale

This device consisted of a tapered baton around which was spirally wrapped a piece of parchment inscribed with the message. 
When unwrapped the parchment bore an incomprehensible set of letters, but when wrapped around another baton of identical 
proportions, the original text reappeared.

-  Cipher Disks

These devices consisted of two rotating concentric circles, both bearing a sequence of 26 letters. 
One disk was used to select plaintext letters, while the other was used for the corresponding cipher component.


### 2. Find two digital ciphers that are being used today.

Commonly used Cipher Suites:

- AES with 128 or 256 Bit

- SHA-2 (SHA-256, SHA384 or SHA-512)
