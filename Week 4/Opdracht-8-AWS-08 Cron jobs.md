# Cron jobs

## What is a Cron job?

" A Cron Job running a system service is called a daemon (background process) "

The Cron-Daemon runs in the background of the system and gives time impulses so that automated tasks (jobs) are executed at specified times. Cron Jobs are recurring tasks that are automated as resource-saving as possible.

## Possible uses of Cron Jobs.

Cron Jobs can be used for individual commands or for the automated execution of periodically recurring and sequential commands.
