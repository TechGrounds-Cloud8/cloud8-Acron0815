# AWS Pricing

### Introduction:

One of the main reasons for moving to the cloud is cost. If done well, public cloud infrastructures can reduce costs significantly compared to traditional data centers. This is done by adopting a pay-as-you-go pricing model and economies of scale.

You pay only for the compute capacity, storage, and outbound data transfer that you use. You never pay for inbound data transfer and data transfer between services within the same region.

AWS lists four advantages of their pricing model:
Pay-as-you-go
Save when you commit
Pay less by using more
Benefit from massive economies of scale

When creating a new AWS account, you automatically get a free-tier account for the first 12 months. Some services are free up to a certain limit with a free-tier account.
Other services are always free. However, those services might be integrated with other services for which you have to pay.

The Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) is used to measure how much an infrastructure would cost if it were hosted the traditional way. This is done by measuring capital expenditures (capex). The cloud pricing model allows you to trade capex for variable expenditure. This can reduce cost by not spending money on capacity you donâ€™t need.


## AWS pricing is calculated similar to your water and electricity bills. You only pay for the services you use. If you stop using it, there are no additional costs or cancellation fees!
